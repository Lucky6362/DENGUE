# Drug Discovery using ChEMBL IDs and Advanced Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the drug discovery process by using ChEMBL database entries and advanced machine learning models. By utilizing ChEMBL IDs for molecules and targets, the project predicts drug-target interactions and generates potential drug candidates using machine learning and generative models.

## Key Features
- **Data Fetching**: Retrieves molecular and bioactivity data from the ChEMBL database using ChEMBL IDs.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performs data cleaning, feature extraction, and statistical analysis on molecular properties and bioactivity data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predicting drug-target interactions and potential side effects.
- **Generative Models**: Uses generative AI (e.g., Variational Autoencoders) to generate new molecules with desired properties.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit or Dash for real-time visualization of the results.
